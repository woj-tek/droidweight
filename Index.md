# The DroidWeight app #


Droid Weight is an easy-to-use but useful weight tracking application for
[Android](http://www.android.com/) smart phones.

If you want to install Droid Weight or see screen shots, please see the
[Droid Weight page on the Android Market](https://market.android.com/details?id=de.delusions.measure).

## Privacy and permissions ##

Droid Weight does not send your data anywhere.

`android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` is required so that you can import and
export your data to and from text files.

If `android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE` shows up once you have installed Droid Weight,
this is due to a bug in android: Droid Weight does not use the phone state or
identity. See [here](http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=4101)
and [here](http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=11080) for more
information.
